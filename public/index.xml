      <description>Welcome! Paperfoo is a project inspired by Adrian Colyer&amp;rsquo;s Morning Paper and Papers We Love. These are my goals for Paperfoo:
 Read 3-4 Computer Science papers per week Write summaries on this website  Why am I doing this?
 I want to develop a habit of consistently reading CS papers. Papers are great at exposing us to foundational as well as cutting edge research that some of the smartest people on the planet are working on Writing summaries is an excellent way for me to reinforce my own understanding This blog will also serve as an archive for the list of papers I read over a period of time  That&amp;rsquo;s it!</description>
