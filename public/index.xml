      <description>Summary of David D. Clark&amp;rsquo;s 1988 paper titled &amp;ldquo;The Design Philoshophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols&amp;rdquo;.
Main idea: 
Why is the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite designed the way it is? 
This paper is an attempt to highlight some of the early reasoning behind the architectural decisions taken while designing the Internet protocols.
Two key ideas:
 the datagram (or connectionless service) layering of separate IP and TCP layers  These ideas were not part of the original proposal.</description>

      <description>About Welcome! Paperfoo is a project inspired by Adrian Colyer&amp;rsquo;s Morning Paper and the Papers We Love community.
These are my goals for Paperfoo:
 Read 3-4 Computer Science papers per week Write summaries on this website  Why am I doing this?
 BradfieldCS got me introduced to the idea of reading foundational papers. I want to develop a habit of consistently reading CS papers. Papers are great at exposing us to foundational as well as cutting edge research that some of the smartest people on the planet are working on.</description>
