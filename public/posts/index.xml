      <description>Summary of David D. Clark&amp;rsquo;s 1988 paper titled &amp;ldquo;The Design Philoshophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols&amp;rdquo;.
Main idea: 
Why is the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite designed the way it is? 
This paper is an attempt to highlight some of the early reasoning behind the architectural decisions taken while designing the Internet protocols.
Two key ideas:
